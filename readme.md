## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of explanations and concepts related to data structures and algorithms. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for any software developer to build efficient and scalable solutions.

## Data Structures

### Array

An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, each identified by an index or a key. It allows efficient access to individual elements based on their index. Arrays are used to store lists of items where the order of the items is significant.

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are stored in nodes. Each node contains the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are dynamic in size and allow efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.

### Stack

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements can be added (pushed) or removed (popped) from the top. The last element that was added is the first to be removed. Stacks are used in algorithms for parsing, backtracking, and depth-first search, among others.

### Queue

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements can be added to the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue). Queues are used in algorithms for scheduling, breadth-first search, and more.

### Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected in a way that resembles a tree. Each node can have a parent and zero or more children. Trees are widely used in computer science for organizing hierarchical data, such as file systems and HTML DOM.

## Algorithms

### Sorting

Sorting algorithms arrange items in a specific order, such as numerical or lexicographical. Common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. The choice of sorting algorithm depends on the use case and desired time complexity.

### Searching

Searching algorithms are used to find a particular item in a collection of items. Common searching algorithms include Linear Search, Binary Search (applicable to sorted collections), and Hash-based searching (e.g., using hash maps).

### Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms operate on graph data structures and are crucial for various applications, including social networks, route planning, and network optimization. Common graph algorithms include Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm (shortest path), and Prim's Algorithm (minimum spanning tree).
