notes:
the tech is blockchain
cryptographic algorithms and merkle trees
decentralization and peoples money


i will give my opinions on the statement and then i will write how it works 

then i will explain  the benefits and give the future scope


The technology that will have a significant future is blockchain,blockchain is a decentralized software that is built by computer engineers by using the concepts of cryptography and secure programming,The main application of the blockchain is crytocurrency and decentralized finance.
The idea of crytocurrency is initially proposed and developed by satoshi nakamoto,who is an anonymous person in the world of technology with a vast and immerse knowledge of cryptographic systems and programming,his ideology changed the world of computer science by his invention of crytocurrency.
the blockchain systems consists of n number of nodes and these nodes are interconnected with each other,once the data is processed on one node it creates a block,then the network will broadcasts the block to the rest of the nework making it decentralized.
This technology is going to rule the computer systems in the future without the need of a centralized authority,which make people more powerfull than the government.
